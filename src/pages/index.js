    <h1>Welcom to Niho GO</h1>
    <div>
      <p>We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. It's cold, but it's beautiful. There are no limits in this world. Don't fight it, use what happens.</p>
      <p>Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. We have a fantastic little sky! You can do it. Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it.</p>
      <p>We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Nothing wrong with washing your brush. A happy cloud. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. There is immense joy in just watching - watching all the little creatures in nature. Maybe there was an old trapper that lived out here and maybe one day he went to check his beaver traps, and maybe he fell into the river and drowned.</p>
      <p>Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things We don't have anything but happy trees here. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. Have fun with it. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world.</p>
      <p>These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. But they're very easily killed. Clouds are delicate. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all.</p>
      <p>Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. If you hypnotize it, it will go away. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Now it's beginning to make a little sense. We'll make some happy little bushes here.</p>
      <p>When you buy that first tube of paint it gives you an artist license. Let's do that again. Let that brush dance around there and play.</p>
